# Insert completed Todoist tasks

The existing Todoist plugins for Obisidian work great for showing a live view of open tasks, but there isn't a way to show a list of completed tasks. This plugin allows you to insert a list of completed tasks into your note.

It integrates with the Daily Note plugin, to automatically insert the completed tasks from the specified day into your daily active note.

## Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.
